# MP Drawdown 2035
Multiplayer version of the first campaign mission of ArmA 3.

## Instructions
- It would be most reliable to host this locally (don't use a dedicated server), that is what it has been tested on.
- It is best if the host is the one to start all interactions, these include:
	- Talking to the Rogain officer
	- Driving the truck
- To skip the video at the start, run ``skipIntro = true`` **globally**.
