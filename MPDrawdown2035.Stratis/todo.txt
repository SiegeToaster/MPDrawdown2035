Bugs:
	the ifs and waitUntils in initServer.sqf return null, might work, but I think once p1 is in it will go regardless of whether other players are in.  Must test
	only p1 exits walk into LZ connor animation
	Adams doesn't wave
	ambient special at LZ connor needs to be fixed; initMission.hpp, line 848
	helicopter teleports direction when taking off from LZ connor
	Adams needs to wait longer before getting out of helicopter (until player cinema borders are gone)
	jets do not fly overhead for Kamino explosion
	
Stops after getting to Point X-Ray
