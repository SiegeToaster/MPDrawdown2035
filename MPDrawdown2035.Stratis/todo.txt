Bugs:
	the ifs and waitUntils in initServer.sqf return null, might work, but I think once p1 is in it will go regardless of whether other players are in.  Must test
	only p1 exits walk into LZ connor animation
	Adams doesn't wave
	ambient special at LZ connor needs to be fixed; initMission.hpp, line 848
	helicopter teleports direction when taking off from LZ connor - this is in the official campaign too, custom fix would be required (lol no)
	Edwards speech waits for a few seconds at different places, sometimes right after saying at ease, sometimes right before saying he has no idea why.
		This is most likely not related to the ambient conversation
	plane1 bugged
	
Stops after getting to Point X-Ray
